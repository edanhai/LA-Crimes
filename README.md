# LA Crime Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of crime data in Los Angeles. The project aims to explore, clean, and model crime data to uncover meaningful patterns and insights. By leveraging data analysis and visualization techniques, it seeks to provide actionable findings for understanding crime trends.

## Key Objectives
- Load and preprocess raw crime data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and anomalies.
- Engineer and analyze features to extract valuable insights.
- Model crime data for predictive or explanatory purposes (optional, based on the notebook's scope).

## Repository Structure
- **`LA Crime.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis workflow.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/la-crime-analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd la-crime-analysis
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "LA Crime.ipynb"
    ```
4. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to load, process, and analyze the data.

## Results
Key findings and visualizations will be generated during the analysis, including:
- Crime frequency over time.
- Geospatial distributions of crime.
- Feature correlations and insights.
